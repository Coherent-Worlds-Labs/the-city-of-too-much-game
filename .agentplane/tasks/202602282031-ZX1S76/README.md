description: "Tune image continuity prompt so high Protocol emphasizes strict realism/order, while high Carnival emphasizes chaotic exaggeration, scaled by absurdity index."

## Summary

Make image prompt generation explicitly react to Protocol/Carnival direction and absurdity level so visuals become stricter or more exaggerated accordingly.

## Scope


## Plan

1) Extend prompt builder input with new_state signal (absurdity + direction). 2) Add deterministic axis directive text for protocol/carnival with stronger language on extremes. 3) Pass signal from runtime playTurn to image pipeline. 4) Add tests for protocol and carnival prompt clauses. 5) Run lint/tests and record verification.

## Risks

Overly strong prompt can break continuity; mitigate by keeping continuity anchors and photorealism constraints while only adjusting stylistic intensity.

## Verify Steps

1) node scripts/lint.mjs exits 0. 2) node --test exits 0. 3) tests/image-pipeline.test.mjs asserts protocol and carnival directives are present for opposite axis signals.

## Verification

## Rollback Plan

Revert this task commits to restore prior neutral continuity prompt behavior.
