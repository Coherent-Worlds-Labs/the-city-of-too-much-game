## Summary

Implement persistence-backed game API services for create game, play turn, read history, and timeline retrieval with transaction-safe turn writes.

## Scope

In scope: database migration schema, SQLite store module, game service API methods, and transaction-safe turn persistence including judge/image artifacts. Out of scope: HTTP framework wiring and auth.

## Plan

1. Add SQLite migration files for `games` and `turns` tables with index coverage.

## Risks

- Risk: SQLite API changes due experimental node module behavior.

## Verify Steps

1. Run `node --test` and confirm persistence/API tests pass.

## Rollback Plan

1. Revert persistence/API commit(s) from this task.

## Context

Core engine, judge adapter, and image pipeline are available. This task introduces persistent storage and API-level service orchestration needed before UI integration.
