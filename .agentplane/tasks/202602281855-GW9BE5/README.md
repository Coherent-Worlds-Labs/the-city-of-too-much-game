## Summary


## Scope


## Plan

1) Add state sync helper in ui/main.js to apply axis/direction/mood/stability from selected history turn. 2) On history click: for Initial/Genesis set neutral baseline; for turn snapshots hydrate from corresponding turn judge state. 3) Keep latest-state behavior unchanged on normal gameplay flow. 4) Run lint and tests, verify and finish.

## Risks
