# the-city-of-too-much-game
Semantic balancing game where each card reshapes a living city between rigid order and joyful absurdity. Themes accumulate, contradictions distort reality, and excess in either direction risks collapse. The background evolves from your choices, visually reflecting the world’s state. Keep the city alive - neither perfectly logical nor chaotic.
